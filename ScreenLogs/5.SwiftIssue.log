 -> YLogging (0.0.1)
    - WARN  | source: The version should be included in the Git tag.
    - WARN  | swift: The validator used Swift 3.2 by default because no Swift version was specified. To specify a Swift version during validation, add the `swift_version` attribute in your podspec. Note that usage of the `--swift-version` parameter or a `.swift-version` file is now deprecated.
    - ERROR | [OSX] xcodebuild: Returned an unsuccessful exit code. You can use `--verbose` for more information.
    - ERROR | [iOS] swift: Swift support uses dynamic frameworks and is therefore only supported on iOS > 8.
